Readme for Age Detection with OpenCV and dlib (.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook code implements an age detection system for images using OpenCV and dlib libraries in Google Colab.

**Functionality:**

Loads an image (specified by path)
Detects faces using a pre-trained dlib model
Predicts age for each detected face using a Caffe model
Displays the image with bounding boxes and predicted ages
**Libraries Required:**

OpenCV (Ensure it's pre-installed in Colab)
dlib (Install using !pip install dlibin the first code cell)
This code also utilizes cv2_imshowfrom google.colab.patchesfor image display in Colab

**Instructions:**

Change Image Path: Update the path to your image file in the line:
Python
img = cv2.imread('/content/Models/minion.jpg')
Use code wisely .

Model Paths: Verify the paths to the pre-trained models in the following lines:
Python
age_weights = "/content/Models/age_deploy.prototxt"  --  Content is the default path and any thing added on the colab envirement will after that 
age_config = "/content/Models/age_net.caffemodel"

**Use code wisely .**

Make sure these models are downloaded and placed in the specified folders within your Colab environment.
Run the Notebook: Execute the code cells sequentially in the notebook.

**Additional Notes:**

This code demonstrates a basic implementation and can be further customized for specific needs.
Ensure you have a stable internet connection in Colab for downloading models if needed.
Disclaimer: The accuracy of the age prediction depends on the quality of the pre-trained model and image conditions.
