**Real-Time Gun Detection with OpenCV**
This Python script utilizes OpenCV to detect guns in a live video stream and display a security feed with timestamps.

**Features:**

Real-time Detection: Analyzes each frame of the video stream for potential guns.
Bounding Boxes: Draws red rectangles around detected guns.
Timestamp Overlay: Displays the current date and time on the video feed.
Gun Detection Notification: Prints "Guns detected" to the console when a gun is found.
Requirements:

**Python 3.x**

OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)
imutils library (pip install imutils)
A pre-trained gun Haar cascade classifier (e.g., GunCascade.xml)
**Instructions:**

Download a trained gun Haar cascade classifier and place it in the same directory as this script (e.g., GunCascade.xml). You can find pre-trained classifiers online.
Run the script: python gun_detection.py
The script will access your webcam and display the security feed. If a gun is detected, a bounding box will be drawn and a message will be printed.
Press 'q' to quit the program.
**Note:**

The accuracy of gun detection depends on the quality of the classifier and the lighting conditions.
This script is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a real-world security application without further development and testing.
**Additional Information:**

This script uses the detectMultiScale function of OpenCV to detect objects in the video frames.
The parameters for detectMultiScale can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of detection.
The script extracts regions of interest (ROIs) around detected guns, which could be used for further processing in a more advanced application.
This README provides a clear overview of the functionality, instructions for use, dependencies, and some additional notes about accuracy and limitations. You can further customize this content by:

**Adding links to resources for finding pre-trained gun classifiers.**
Providing details on how to adjust the detectMultiScale parameters and their impact on detection.
Including information on potential applications with modifications (e.g., triggering an alarm).
